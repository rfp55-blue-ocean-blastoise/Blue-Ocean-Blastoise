# Book Viewer

- Once you have selected a book from your library you will be transitioned to the book viewer and the narration of the book will begin.

 - If you click the cogwheel it will open up additional settings for the voice narration of your book. Here you can change things such as speed of narration,
pitch of the voice narrating, choosing the voice that narrates the book, and adjusting the volume for the narrator and background sound. (Current background sound is a campfire)
